A simple app with:
- MVVM
- Coroutines
- Hilt DI
- Retrofit, OkHttp and Chucker
- Room Database
- Android Navigation Component
- Fast Adapter
- Glide
- Somewhat Clean Architecture (?)

Sorry for very basic & minimum unit testing and no integration ui testing, I'm still learning how to use it and do it properly.
With a chance and a guidance I think I will be able to do it in the future.
